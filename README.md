# COVID19 HACKATHON

The idea behind the app is to crowdsource the information about the crowds at specific locations.
Thus, everyone can then view the crowd as shared by the people across multiple locations.

# HOW TO RUN:

Do the following commands:
```
cd frontend/
npm install
npm start
```

Now, install the Expo App in the mobile, and scan the QR code to open the application in the mobile.

The start user details are `mayankprasoon` and `password`
